# Author: Derick Nyende

# Project name: Dinoparks Take Home Challenge

# Problem Approach
1. I started by reading through the challenge doc to determine what the goal of the challenge was and the expected result.

2. I chose the languages and ide I thought would be best for this project. I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE and JavaScript as my development language, while also making use of node.js and react.js to assist in devloping.
3. Section breakdown:
  CSS - to have the styles and layouts of my elements preset; 
  JSX - creates the HTML that controls the functionality of the web page elements;
  Data Extraction - a function that would extract the data from the server and store it in a variable for easy access;
  Grid Elements - these take in the given data and change there appearance in the grid according to the data

# What I would do differently

I would have liked to get the web-app to work exactly as I intended. 

I would have found a better way to create the grid that is faster and less prone to errors.

# What I learnt

I learnt a lot about CSS, HTML and what it takes to develop interactive and dynamic web-apps

I learnt how to use React to fast-track my app development

Although I already knew some JavaScript, I learnt a lot more of its functionalities and capabilities with this challenge

# How the challenge can be improved

I think the event objects could have been more consistent and compatible with the task. It was a challenge to go from the object/json data to producing data for the specific cell blocks but that might have been done deliberately for the coding challenge. Otherwise, everything was very clear, well thought out and properly explained.

# Setup and running

# Node.js is needed to run the app

# Type 'npm start' to run the app in development mode

In this mode you can make changes to the code and it will immediately reflect on the browser

In this mode the app can be viewed at 'http://localhost:3000'

# Type 'npm install -g serve'
This is needed to deploy the app as a static server

# Type 'npm run build'
This will build the production version of the web app

# Type 'serve -s build' to deploy static server of the app

This will run the app at 'http://localhost:5000' on your browser and can be viewed there

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
